### Smart Loading Installation and Usage Guide

Welcome to the Smart Loading GitHub repository! This application leverages PHP and Python to optimize container loading processes. It integrates a PHP-based web interface with a Python Flask backend to calculate and display optimal loading strategies.

#### Prerequisites
Before beginning the installation, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Git**: Version control system to clone the repository.
- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher.
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Flask: Python framework required to run the backend. Install using pip install flask.
- **XAMPP** or any similar server software that supports PHP.

#### Installation Steps

**Step 1: Cloning the Repository**
To get a copy of the Smart Loading project on your local machine, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yancey7521/isteamwork.git
```

This command clones the repository and creates a directory named `smart-loading` in your current working directory.

**Step 2: Navigating to the Project Directory**
Change your directory to the newly created project directory:

```sh
cd smart-loading
```

**Step 3: Setting Up the Server Environment**
1. Install XAMPP or another PHP server environment.
2. Ensure that the PHP and Apache modules are running.
3. Copy the `smart-loading` directory into the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation.

**Step 4: Starting the Servers**

- **PHP Server:**
  - Access `project_irs.php` through your web browser by navigating to:
    ```plaintext
    http://localhost/smart-loading/project_irs.php
    ```
  - This page is used for managing item data and generating container loading plans.

- **Python Flask Server:**
  - Open a command prompt or terminal in the project directory.
  - Run the following command to start the Flask server:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
  - Ensure the Flask application is running to handle backend requests made by `project_irs.php`.

#### Usage Guide
After setting up the application, follow these steps to use Smart Loading:

1. **Adding Items:**
   - Go to `http://localhost/smart-loading/project_irs.php` in your web browser.
   - Use the provided form to input details of the items to be loaded into containers (length, width, height, weight, color, quantity).
   - Click "Add Item" to store the item in the session. Items will be displayed in a table with an option to delete any item.

2. **Generating Container Loading Plan:**
   - After adding all necessary items, click "Generate Container Loading Plan."
   - This sends the item data as a JSON payload via a POST request to the Flask server (`app.py`), which processes the request and returns an optimized loading configuration.
   - The PHP script then visualizes this configuration on the webpage, displaying how items are arranged within the container.
