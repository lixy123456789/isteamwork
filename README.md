## Introduction

In today's fast-paced global supply chain, optimizing container loading is crucial for reducing costs, minimizing waste, and enhancing operational efficiency. Smart Loading addresses this challenge by harnessing the potential of genetic algorithms to find the optimal arrangement of packages within a container, maximizing space utilization and ensuring a balanced distribution of weight.

## Features

- üß¨ Genetic Algorithm: Smart Loading employs a powerful genetic algorithm to explore a vast solution space and find the best packing configuration.
- üì¶ 3D Packing Optimization: The algorithm takes into account the dimensions and weights of packages, ensuring efficient utilization of container space.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Weight Distribution: Smart Loading aims to evenly distribute the weight across the container, promoting stability and reducing the risk of damage during transportation.
- üåê Cross-Platform Compatibility: The project is implemented in Python, making it compatible with various operating systems and easy to integrate into existing logistics systems.
- üìä Data Visualization: Smart Loading provides intuitive visualizations of the packing results, allowing users to understand and analyze the optimized container configurations.
